This lab was a group assignment during the summer 2014 section of this class.

The goal was to implement a proxy server that accepts requests from clients,
forwards them to the destination server, recieves and returns the response from
the destination, and caches the result. All concurrently.

By completing this assignment we learned both about network communication and 
handling concurrency. 

Jeff did the work for the initial proxy without caching or concurrency while
Cory worked on designing the cache and concurrency support. When Jeff finished
the basic proxy he helped Cory debug the cache.
